##Day 1 Morning: Git and R Markdown
For cross-platform compatability (windows/mac), consider using file.path

```{r}
p<-file.path("folder1","folder2","file.txt" )
```

### Some thoughts on reproducibility:
each project should have three folders:

1. raw/ -- raw data only

2. processed/ -- cleaned data

3. code/

4. readme.md -- document files in other subfolders

##Day 1 Afternoon: Bioconductor
